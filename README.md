# High-Cycle-Fatigue-Tool (HCFT or HcFatFit)
A tool with GUI (Graphical User Interface) for processing CSV files obtained from fatigue experiments up to the high-cycle fatigue ranges. Additionally, tests with monotonic loading can be processed.

## Features:
1. Simple plot functionality for columns of the CSV file.
2. Extracting Max and Min values and filtering the undesired cycles.
3. Extracting and plotting the fatigue creep curve (cycles number vs displacement).
4. Smoothing function for fatigue creep curves.
5. Ability to process file with +10 Gb size.
6. Graphical User Interface with all functions and parameters
