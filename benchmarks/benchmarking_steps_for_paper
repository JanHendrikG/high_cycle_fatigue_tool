The final goal is to be able to..
1- Apply custom filters to data
2- Plot the original and filtered results
efficiently in terms of (Memory usage + Speed)

1- Apply custom filters to data:
To do this we need to prepare the CSV columns in a format that we can process numerically. Here the well established
numpy arrays are targeted. 


What do you need to do with the CSV result file (the pipeline)?
1- Load CSV and prepare columns for processing (by saving them to .npy or .hdf)
2- Filtering Do some operations


1- Loading the csv into numpy arrays to make the needed manipulation and to save as npy
